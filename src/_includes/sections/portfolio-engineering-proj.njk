        I successfully demonstrated the synchronization of Data from GPS, Lidar, and Camera sensors by utilizing the PPS signal from the GPS.
        I employed ROSpy and RViz for data visualization.
        I led a team of five accomplished engineering students, underscoring my adept teamwork and project coordination skills.") }}
