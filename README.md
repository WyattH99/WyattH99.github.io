# RobotArm_stm32

This repo contains the projects for my STM32 Nucleo-F446RE based Robotic Arm project.
The Robotic Arm Design and STL files were adapted from an Open Source project from the YouTube Channel "Build Some Stuff." The goal was to implement the project using my STM32 board instead of his Arduino.
All Projects were developed using STM32CubeIDE.
The first project in this repo is the "PotentiometerToServo" project. This is were I developed the base understanding of mapping the potentiometers to their corresponding servo.
After Printing and Assembling the Arm I created the "RobotArm_stm32" project. In which is the finished code for the STM32.
